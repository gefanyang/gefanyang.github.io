## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen, under the supervision of [Prof. Stefan Sommer](https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/stefan-horst-sommer). My research interests are in the statistical machine learning and stochastic processes.

## Research Areas

- **Statistical machine learning:** Bayesian inference, parameter estimations.
- **Stochastic Processes:** diffusion processes, stochastic differential equations.
- **Deep Learning:** diffusion models, neural differential equations.
